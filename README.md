## Hello Modz Innovation member.

This is a page dedicated to members that are discovering C++ with a member project.

Briefly: **What is C++**

C++ is an object oriented programming language based on C.

> [!WARNING]
> Based on C does not mean its the same language. please dont code in C

### Object Oriented

In object oriented programming, we are using objects ([classes](https://github.com/Modz-Innovation/Cpp-cheat-sheet/wiki/What-is-a-class)) to manage behaviors all along the code.

this mean that ***stand alone functions*** are barely forbiden. Make it a class.

### Why C++

C++ is one of the oldest OOP langage, it is fast, low level, and compatible with any C library,
this mean that it is very flexible and maintainable. the C++ standart is very rich and very optimized.

The main reason why we choose C++ languages for Modz innovation projects is because of optimization and maintnability with Epitech students.
